# :octocat: GitHub Collaboration Tools

Welcome! 👋

Kris Johnson, Natural Resources Research Institute (NRRI)

**Goal:** Learn how to collaborate on code reviews with Pull Requests.  
**Format:** Short intro → Live demo → Wrap-up

## 🗂️ What is Version Control? (Git)

- Track history of changes
- Revert mistakes easily
- Work with others at the same time
- eg. Google Docs

---

## ⚙️ How Git Works

- **Repository** = project folder
- **Commits** = snapshots of changes
- **Branches** = where the development (work) happens

## 🤝 Collaboration Workflow (Git)

- Create a branch → make changes → open a Pull Request
- Review happens on the PR
- Merge → changes land in `main`

## ☁️ Quick Refresher: GitHub

- Git = version control engine
- GitHub = collaboration layer on top of Git
- Key features:
  - **Issues** → track work
  - **Pull Requests (PR)** → propose & review changes
  - **Reviews** → comments, suggestions, approvals

---

## 📝 Demo Overview

We’ll use a **tiny poem generator app** as our example.

**Three PRs, each showcasing a different aspect of collaboration:**

1. **PR 1:** Review basics (comments & suggestions)
2. **PR 2:** Feedback loop (request changes, re-review)
3. **PR 3:** Reviewer tools (draft PRs, labels, batch comments)

---

## ✅ Wrap-Up / Key Takeaways

- **PRs are the hub of collaboration**
- Reviews improve both code quality _and_ shared understanding
- Collaboration = comments, suggestions, iteration, approvals
- GitHub adds structure: branch protection, auto-merge, issue linking
- Start small → practice reviewing each other’s code!
